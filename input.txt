A Small Tale

Once upon a time in a quiet valley, a young girl named Mira discovered a
tiny glowing seed beneath an ancient oak tree. Curious, she planted it
in the soft earth near her home.

Each night, the seed shimmered a different color—blue, then violet, then
gold. Within a week, it sprouted into a luminous flower taller than Mira
herself. The villagers gathered to witness the marvel, believing it was
a gift from the valley spirits.

But one morning, the flower wilted suddenly, leaving behind a single
radiant petal. Mira picked it up and felt warmth spread through her
hand. The petal whispered—not in words, but in feelings—guiding her
toward the mountains.

With courage, Mira followed. At the mountain’s peak, she released the
petal into the wind. It burst into a cascade of light, restoring life to
the valley below. Flowers bloomed, rivers sparkled anew, and the oak
tree sang softly in the breeze.

Mira returned home a hero, though she never claimed the title. She
simply smiled, knowing that even the smallest discoveries can hold great
wonders.
